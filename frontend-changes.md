  - `updateThemeToggleAccessibility()`: Updates ARIA labels dynamically

## Features Implemented

### 1. Toggle Button Design
- Circular floating button in top-right corner
- Sun/moon icons that switch based on current theme
- Smooth hover effects with scale animations
- Keyboard accessible with focus indicators
- Mobile responsive sizing

### 2. Theme System
- **Dark Theme (default)**: Original dark blue color scheme
- **Light Theme**: Clean white background with dark text for optimal readability
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Smooth transitions between themes (0.3s ease)

### 3. Persistence
- Theme preference saved to localStorage
- Automatic theme restoration on page load
- Defaults to dark theme if no preference is saved

### 4. Accessibility
- Dynamic ARIA labels that update based on current theme
- Keyboard navigation support
- Proper color contrast ratios in both themes
- Focus indicators that work in both themes

### 5. User Experience
- Instant theme switching with smooth animations
- 180-degree rotation animation on button click
- Visual feedback on all interactive states
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes

## Technical Implementation Details

### CSS Variables Structure
- Both themes use identical variable names for consistency
- Light theme overrides applied via `[data-theme="light"]` selector
- All components reference CSS custom properties for automatic theme switching

### JavaScript Theme Management
- Theme stored as 'dark' or 'light' string in localStorage
- DOM data-theme attribute controls which CSS theme is active
- Button accessibility attributes update dynamically

### Icon System
- Uses SVG icons for crisp display at all sizes
- Icons hidden/shown via CSS display properties based on theme
- Sun icon (#f59e0b) visible in light theme, moon icon visible in dark theme

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with CSS custom properties support
- localStorage support required for persistence
- SVG support required for icons
- No external dependencies beyond existing marked.js library

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. System theme detection (prefers-color-scheme media query)
2. Additional theme variants (high contrast, custom colors)
3. Animation preferences respect for reduced motion
4. Theme-specific custom scrollbar styling
